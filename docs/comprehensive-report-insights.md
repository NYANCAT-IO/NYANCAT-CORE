# Comprehensive Report Implementation Insights

This document captures all insights from implementing the comprehensive backtest reporting feature.

## What We Built

### Comprehensive Backtest Engine
- Extended `SimpleBacktestEngine` to capture detailed trade context
- Tracks entry/exit funding rates and APRs
- Records exit reasoning (why positions were closed)
- Detailed P&L breakdown: spot, perp, funding, fees
- Tracks concurrent positions and time metrics

### Dual Report System
1. **Simple Report** (existing): Quick overview with equity curve
2. **Comprehensive Report** (new): Full transparency including:
   - Monthly performance breakdown
   - Symbol-by-symbol analysis
   - All trades with complete context
   - Interactive charts (Chart.js) and sortable tables (DataTables)

### CLI Updates
- Changed default backtest period: 30 → 90 days
- Added `--report` option: simple, comprehensive, or both
- Demo mode still uses 7 days for quick testing

## Key Discoveries

### The Meme Coin Problem

During 30-day historical data fetch, we discovered many errors:
```
fetchOHLCV for 1000000BABYDOGE/USDT attempt 1 failed: BadSymbol: bybit does not have market symbol 1000000BABYDOGE/USDT
Failed to fetch spot prices for 1000000BABYDOGE/USDT
```

**Root Cause**: Many perpetual contracts don't have corresponding spot markets:
- Perpetual: `1000000BABYDOGE/USDT:USDT` ✓ (exists)
- Spot: `1000000BABYDOGE/USDT` ✗ (doesn't exist)

**Impact**: 
- Can't actually trade delta-neutral without spot market
- Current code uses perp prices for both legs (unrealistic)
- Explains poor 30-day backtest performance (-7.17% return)

### Performance Reality Check

Original estimates were too optimistic:
- **365-day backtest**: Actually 30-90 seconds (not < 30s)
- **90-day backtest**: 5-15 seconds (acceptable)
- **30-day backtest**: 2-10 seconds (good)

Bottlenecks:
- Linear search through arrays O(n²) complexity
- ~48 million operations for 365 days
- No indexing or optimization

### Backtest Results Analysis

**7-day demo (BTC/ETH only)**:
- Return: +0.78% (40.7% annualized)
- Win rate: 0% (but profitable due to funding accumulation)
- Stable, predictable results

**30-day test (top 20 by volume)**:
- Return: -7.17% (-87.2% annualized)
- Win rate: 71.4%
- Included many meme coins with extreme volatility
- Example: 10000LADYS funding went to -649.3% APR!

## How Current Backtest Works

The backtest **dynamically** selects opportunities:

1. **Entry Logic** (every 8 hours):
   ```typescript
   for (const [symbol, rate] of fundingRates.rates) {
     const apr = rate * 3 * 365 * 100;
     if (apr >= minAPR && !openPositions.has(symbol)) {
       opportunities.push({ symbol, apr });
     }
   }
   opportunities.sort((a, b) => b.apr - a.apr); // Highest APR first
   ```

2. **Position Management**:
   - Max 5 concurrent positions
   - Equal weight sizing (20% max per position)
   - Enters highest APR opportunities first

3. **Exit Conditions**:
   - Funding turns negative
   - Funding drops below minAPR/2
   - Backtest ends

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Structure
```
src/lib/backtest/
├── types.ts                    # Added DetailedPosition, MonthlyStats, SymbolStats
├── engine.ts                   # SimpleBacktestEngine (unchanged)
├── comprehensive-engine.ts     # New: Detailed tracking
├── report.ts                   # Simple report generator
├── comprehensive-report.ts     # New: Full analysis report
└── index.ts                    # Updated exports
```

### Key Type Additions
```typescript
interface DetailedPosition extends Position {
  entryFundingRate: number;
  entryFundingAPR: number;
  exitFundingRate: number;
  exitFundingAPR: number;
  exitReason: string;
  holdingPeriodHours: number;
  fundingPeriodsHeld: number;
  spotPnL: number;
  perpPnL: number;
  totalFunding: number;
  entryFees: number;
  exitFees: number;
}
```

### Report Generation
- HTML: Self-contained with CDN libraries
- JSON: Complete data for API integration
- Monthly aggregation for performance trends
- Symbol ranking by profitability

## Problems to Solve

1. **Invalid Delta-Neutral Pairs**
   - Many perps don't have spot markets
   - Need to filter for valid pairs only
   - Current approach is unrealistic

2. **Symbol Selection**
   - "Top 20 by volume" includes untradeable meme coins
   - Should be "all pairs with both spot and perp"
   - Let backtest data determine best opportunities

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Could index funding rates by timestamp
   - Binary search for price lookups
   - Parallel processing for symbols

## Lessons Learned

1. **Meme coins are problematic** for delta-neutral:
   - Extreme funding volatility (-649% APR!)
   - Often no spot market
   - Unreliable for consistent returns

2. **Data quality matters**:
   - Must validate both markets exist
   - Fallback to perp prices creates false results
   - Better to skip than use bad data

3. **Performance expectations**:
   - Be honest about processing time
   - 90 days is good balance for demos
   - Pre-caching essential for hackathon

4. **Dynamic selection works well**:
   - Algorithm already picks best opportunities
   - Just needs valid pairs to choose from
   - Don't need to pre-select symbols

## Next Steps

1. Implement valid pair discovery
2. Re-run backtests with only tradeable pairs
3. Analyze which pairs consistently perform well
4. Create curated list for live trading

The comprehensive reporting system is complete and working. The main improvement needed is ensuring we only backtest pairs that can actually be traded delta-neutral.
