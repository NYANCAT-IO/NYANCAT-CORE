# Context Reset Summary

## Quick Reference for Continuing Work

### What Was Built

1. **Delta-Neutral Analyzer** (`pnpm analyze-delta`)
   - Fetches spot and perpetual data from Bybit
   - Matches pairs for arbitrage opportunities
   - Calculates basis, funding rates, and expected returns
   - Supports long-spot-short-perp and short-spot-long-perp strategies

2. **Enhanced Data Fetcher** (`pnpm fetch-bybit`)
   - Fetches both spot and perpetual tickers
   - Saves to JSON files with timestamps
   - Includes funding rate analysis

### What Works

- ✅ Basic data fetching (1248 tickers: 660 spot + 588 perpetual)
- ✅ Pair matching algorithm
- ✅ CLI interface with multiple options
- ✅ JSON and CSV output formats
- ✅ Funding rate calculations
- ✅ Data quality warnings

### What's Broken/Suspicious

- ❌ Funding rates show suspicious clustering (34% at 0.005%, 18% at 0.01%)
- ❌ Too many assets have identical funding rates
- ❌ Results seem unrealistic or too uniform
- ❌ Fee calculations might eliminate all opportunities

### Key Commands

```bash
# Fetch fresh data
pnpm fetch-bybit

# Run analysis
pnpm analyze-delta

# Debug with specific asset
pnpm analyze-delta --asset BTC

# Check with fees
pnpm analyze-delta --include-fees
```

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priority**: Debug funding rate parsing
   - Add logging to see raw ticker data
   - Verify funding rates against Bybit website
   - Test CCXT's fetchFundingRate() method directly

2. **Investigation Areas**:
   - `/src/lib/market-data/bybit-fetcher.ts` - Line 77-81 (funding rate parsing)
   - `/src/lib/delta-neutral/data-loader.ts` - Line 142-146 (pair validation)
   - `/src/lib/delta-neutral/analyzer.ts` - Line 72-85 (rate extraction)

3. **Key Questions**:
   - Is `ticker.info.fundingRate` the correct field?
   - Are we parsing the rates correctly?
   - Is this normal market behavior or a bug?

### Important Files

- `/docs/delta-neutral-analyzer-debugging.md` - Detailed debugging guide
- `/docs/funding-rate-analysis.md` - Rate distribution analysis
- `/plans/delta-neutral-analyzer.md` - Implementation plan with known issues
- `/claude.md` - Development rules and practices

### Environment Setup

Make sure `.env` has:
```
BYBIT_MAINNET_API_KEY=xxx
BYBIT_MAINNET_API_SECRET=xxx
```

### Quick Debug Test

```javascript
// Test funding rate directly with CCXT
import ccxt from 'ccxt';
const exchange = new ccxt.bybit({ 
  apiKey: 'xxx', 
  secret: 'xxx' 
});
const funding = await exchange.fetchFundingRate('BTC/USDT:USDT');
console.log(funding);
```

This should help you quickly get back up to speed after context reset!
