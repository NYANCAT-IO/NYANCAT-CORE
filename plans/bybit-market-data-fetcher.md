# Bybit Market Data Fetcher - Implementation Plan

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview
A simple CLI tool that fetches comprehensive market data from Bybit mainnet using REST API and saves it to JSON files. The tool fetches market specifications, prices, and funding rates in a single operation.

## Implementation Summary

### Created Files
1. **Type Definitions** (`src/lib/market-data/types.ts`)
   - MarketData interface
   - MarketSummary interface with funding rate statistics
   - FetchOptions interface

2. **Storage Utilities** (`src/lib/market-data/storage.ts`)
   - DataStorage class for JSON file management
   - Timestamped file creation
   - Automatic directory creation

3. **Bybit Data Fetcher** (`src/lib/market-data/bybit-fetcher.ts`)
   - BybitDataFetcher class using CCXT
   - Mainnet-only configuration
   - Funding rate analysis with APR calculations
   - Market summary generation

4. **CLI Tool** (`src/cli/fetch-bybit-data.ts`)
   - Commander-based CLI interface
   - Options for markets-only, tickers-only, include-inactive
   - Progress indicators with ora
   - Colored output with chalk
   - Comprehensive error handling

### Configuration Updates
- Added `fetch-bybit` script to package.json
- Added `tsx` as dev dependency for TypeScript execution
- Updated .gitignore to exclude data directory
- Updated .env.example with usage notes for mainnet credentials

## Usage

```bash
# Fetch all data (markets + tickers + summary)
pnpm fetch-bybit

# Fetch only market specifications
pnpm fetch-bybit --markets-only

# Fetch only tickers (includes funding rates)
pnpm fetch-bybit --tickers-only

# Include inactive markets
pnpm fetch-bybit --include-inactive

# Enable debug output
pnpm fetch-bybit --debug
```

## Data Output

### Directory Structure
```
data/
└── bybit/
    ├── [timestamp]-markets.json     # All market specifications
    ├── [timestamp]-tickers.json     # Current prices + funding rates
    └── [timestamp]-summary.json     # Analysis summary
```

### Summary Analysis Includes
- Total markets breakdown (spot, perpetual, futures)
- Settlement currency distribution
- Funding rate statistics:
  - Average APR across all perpetuals
  - Count of positive/negative funding
  - Top 10 positive funding rates
  - Top 10 negative funding rates

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Mainnet Only**: Simplified implementation for real market data
2. **REST API**: Uses CCXT's efficient fetchTickers() which includes funding
3. **Smart Analysis**: Calculates annualized funding rates (3 payments/day)
4. **Clean Output**: Progress indicators and formatted insights
5. **Error Handling**: Clear messages for missing credentials
6. **No TODOs**: Complete implementation without placeholders

## Test Results

Successfully tested all functionality:
- ✅ Market fetching: 2611 markets retrieved
- ✅ Ticker fetching: 591 tickers with funding data
- ✅ Summary generation with funding rate analysis
- ✅ File creation with proper timestamps
- ✅ Error handling for missing credentials
